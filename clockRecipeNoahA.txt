Lets:

convert = 60 (for converting seconds -> minutes, and minutes -> hours)
newDay = 24 (for resetting hours after it reaches 24)


Vars:

seconds
minutes
hours
timeString

Calculations and Flow Control:

print the current time in 24-hour format
add to seconds, minutes, and hours

while loops checking if seconds and minutes are still over 60
if statements for checking if hours is over 24, and if seconds/minutes are over 60

Directions:
make an app representing a clock by using these variables
use seconds, minutes, and hours to keep track of seconds, minutes, and hours, respectively. 
use the lets to convert seconds to minutes, and minutes to hours once they are above or at 60, and hours reset back to 0 upon hitting 24
combine the int values into a string and put it into timeString for easy printing
add time in different increments, then print out the time at 3 different points after adding values to seconds, minutes, and hours
